### Standards

The Laravel-Toolbox application is [PSR-2](https://github.com/php-fig/fig-standards/blob/master/accepted/PSR-2-coding-style-guide.md) compliant (and PSR-0 and PSR-1, which PSR-2 extends).
PSR-2 is a coding standard by PHP-FIG which aims to unify the way PHP code gets written, so that everyone collaborating on a project will adhere to the same standards. This makes the code easier to read and understand.
